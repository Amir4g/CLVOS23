This repository contains information for the CLVOS23 dataset.

## Download

The frames of three videos [rat,dressage,blueboy] are from the Long Videos dataset, and are available to download separately from [Long Videos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gvclsu/long-videos).

## File Structure

The dataset consists of two parts: `JPEGImages` which holds the frame images, and `Annotations` which contains the corresponding segmentation masks. The frame images are numbered using five-digit numbers. Annotations are saved in color-pattlate mode PNGs like [DAVIS](https://davischallenge.org/).

The provided annotations are for the validation set and include the first and the last frame.
The details of dataset are provided in following table.
